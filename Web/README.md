# NFX Web - WAVE

 NFX provides a full-featured web stack including its own application server. The stack is called
 "NFX WAVE" which stands for "Web Applications with View Enhancements".
 
 WAVE has two tiers: server (NFX.WAVE) and client (WV.js). You can use those tiers separately, or 
 together in which case the most automation is achieved.
