NFX Documentation [http://nfxlib.com](http://nfxlib.com)


The purpose of this repo is to show how to use various **NFX features by example**. 

The major sections of NFX are segregated into separate folders with corresponding names.


In the majority of cases no special documentation is required as projects are commented and 
self-explanatory. Just browse the projects source - all help is in the comments
and local markdowns (if any).

Unless otherwise noted (e.g. for MySQL and Mongo DB), **no 3rd party installation of any software (including Nuget)**
is required as NFX is a self-contained system that relies only on .NET framework (and Net Core support is in plans for 2018)
